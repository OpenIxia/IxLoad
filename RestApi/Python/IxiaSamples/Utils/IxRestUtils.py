DESCRIPTION

IxRestUtils is a collection of classes that offer a generic wrapper around a raw REST API.

It handles:
- Creating a connection;
- Running HTTP methods for an active connection

Abstracting the RAW HTTP input / output to tangible objects that will act as an interface to the REST API.
