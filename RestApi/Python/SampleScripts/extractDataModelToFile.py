extractDataModelToFile.py

Description
   Upload a saved configuration to IxLoad gateway servr and extract
   the data model to a text file.

   Note: This script supports Windows and Linux IxLoad gateway.  
         You will see if conditions for Windows or Linux throughout this script.

Requirement:
   - IxL_RestApi.py library module
   - It is located in the ../Modules folder
        
Steps:
   - Connect to IxLoad Gateway server to create a session.
   - Upload the saved config to the gateway server.
   - Load the saved config file.
   - Extract data model.
   - Download the file as ixLoadConfigDataModel.txt to
     the target location of your preference.
   - Delete the session.
