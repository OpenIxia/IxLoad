IxLoad - REST API templates

The four python scripts present in this folder represent templates of how REST API can be used in order to run IxLoad tests. 
Each template file contains all the data needed to run a test - configuration file, chassis, ports, IxLoad build.

In order to run any of the templates, users will have to install the 'requests' and 'pyOpenSSL' modules in their Python executable. This can be done using 'pip'.
